      <h2>John Doe</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone, I'm Sajal Namdeo, currently a second-year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering at IIIT Ranchi. Passionate about web development, I'm constantly honing my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. Our initiative to assist blind individuals stemmed from a collective desire to make a meaningful impact. As part of this endeavor, I played a key role in the development of our website, contributing to its design and frontend development. Leveraging the fusion of machine learning and web development, our aim was to empower visually impaired individuals. Through this project, we aspire to bridge accessibility gaps and foster inclusivity in our digital landscape</p>
